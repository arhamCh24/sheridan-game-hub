# ✳ Sheridan Game Hub

**Discover. Play. Explore.** A single-site game experience for prospective students at Sheridan Open House.

> **Project status (November 2026):** Playable Tech Sprint, Campus Quest, Hardware Challenge, Find the Undercover, and Program Explorer. The separate Kahoot card remains Coming Soon. This is a student-built activity, not an official Sheridan College service.

## What's ready

- Responsive Sheridan-inspired homepage with six game slots
- New player registration with automatic **4-digit code**
- Returning players can use that code on another station
- Player name and accumulated Sheridan Points in the header
- Finish & Switch Player plus **10-minute inactivity timeout**, suspended during active gameplay
- Shared scoring: **0–100 points per game; only the highest attempt counts**
- Separate fullscreen-friendly live leaderboard at `leaderboard.html` (not linked in the portal)
- A playable **Tech Sprint** quiz for end-to-end testing
- **No npm / frameworks / backend server** required for site hosting

## Get running in minutes

1. Extract the folder and open a local web server in it:
   ```bash
   cd sheridan-game-hub
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` and `http://localhost:8080/leaderboard.html` in separate tabs.
3. Without Firebase configuration, the app clearly displays **DEMO MODE**. This uses browser storage, useful for testing on one computer; **it does not sync between computers.**
4. Create a player, save the four-digit code, play **Tech Sprint**, then view the leaderboard. Try the Returning Player tab after switching.

> Opening HTML files directly as `file://` may block JavaScript modules. Use the tiny HTTP server above, or publish on GitHub Pages.

## Enable true real-time multi-computer scoring (Firebase)

This is **required for the Open House**. GitHub Pages serves static files only; Firebase supplies the shared database and real-time listeners.

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.
2. Add a **Web app** and copy its public Firebase configuration values.
3. Go to **Authentication → Sign-in method → Anonymous** and enable it. This runs invisibly; students do not create accounts or enter emails.
4. Create a **Cloud Firestore** database in Native mode. **Do not publish test-mode/unrestricted security rules.**
5. Open Firestore **Rules**, replace the rules with the exact contents of [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules), then **Publish**.
6. Open [`js/config.js`](./js/config.js) and fill in `firebase.apiKey`, `firebase.authDomain`, `firebase.projectId`, and `firebase.appId`. Firebase web configuration is **not a secret**; database security is enforced by Firestore Rules.
7. Publish to GitHub Pages, then test **two different computers** and the scoreboard display.

For a project Pages URL (`https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/`) this site uses **relative paths** and works under the repository subfolder.

### GitHub Pages publishing

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `sheridan-game-hub`).
2. Upload all files and folders from this directory to the repository root (do **not** nest the folder an extra level).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, `main`, and `/ (root)`; save.
4. Open `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/`.
5. For the separate TV screen enter `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/leaderboard.html` in the address bar; you can use the screen's fullscreen button.

## Add a game in 3 steps

1. Add its game files in `games/new-game/` (e.g. `index.html`, `game.js`, `game.css`).
2. Add its entry in [`js/config.js`](./js/config.js) with `id`, `status: 'playable'`, `competitive: true`, and `href: 'games/new-game/index.html'`.
3. For a competitive game, add its ID to the allowed list in [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules) and republish the rules. Import the shared store and submit a **completed 0–100 score** through `store.submitScore('new-game', points)`.

Minimal game outline (use **relative** URLs from its folder):

```js
import { initStore } from "../../js/store.js";
import { initChrome, requirePlayer, setGameplayActive } from "../../js/ui.js";

const store = await initStore();
initChrome(store);
// Before the game begins, even if the visitor typed the game URL directly:
await requirePlayer("My Game");
setGameplayActive(true);
// Run your actual gameplay and determine the final normalized score.
setGameplayActive(false);
const result = await store.submitScore("new-game", 85);
console.log(result); // { points, previous, gained, best, total }
```

Only mark a game playable after you have tested its complete flow; leave unfinished games as `status: 'soon'`.

### Integrating Campus Quest

If your original Campus Quest uses Vite/React, its **built static output** can still be served from a folder under this same GitHub Pages site. Integrate the player context and completion submission via a small adapter, or migrate its gameplay files when time permits. Do not assume that copying Vite source files directly into a vanilla JavaScript folder will work.

## Scoring specification

- **100 maximum Sheridan Points** from each competitive game.
- Only the **best completed attempt per game** contributes to ranking.
- Score documents are stored once per player/game. The portal **calculates totals from those documents**, rather than allowing browsers to write arbitrary overall totals.
- Rankings sort by points descending, then number of games completed, then nickname, then player ID.
- `Program Discovery` is exploratory and does not earn competitive points.
- The Kahoot-themed slot is currently a placeholder for a **future in-portal quiz**; no external website is launched.
- To reset for a future event, change `eventId` in `js/config.js`. The database data is segregated by event.

## Data layout

```text
events/{eventId}/
  profiles/{playerId}        public nickname and creation metadata
  codes/{fourDigitPin}       private lookup: PIN -> player ID (get-only; no list)
  memberships/{anonUid}      private station association to player ID and PIN
  scores/{playerId_gameId}  public game ID and best score (NO PIN)
```

The browser automatically gets a temporary **Firebase Anonymous Authentication** identity. This is only used to apply basic database permissions; **it is not a student login system**. A returning student uses their PIN, which changes the station's current player association.

## Important limitations

- **Four digits are intentionally easy to remember, not secure.** Anyone who guesses a valid code can access that player's event profile. Do not use this for prizes or personally sensitive information.
- Since there is no trusted game server, a determined user can forge a completed score. Rules limit values and prevent total-score inflation or changing another player's score without claiming their PIN, but **cannot verify whether answers were correct**.
- Firebase Authentication helps restrict writes to temporary browser identities; it is **not a substitute for a protected server** or strong rate limiting. Four-digit code guessing cannot be reliably blocked by client-only JavaScript.
- Never expose emails, phone numbers, student numbers or private information in public nicknames.
- An event organizer can manually remove inappropriate entries in Firebase Console if necessary; this release has no staff dashboard.
- Firestore requires internet connectivity. Transactions fail offline; the app displays an error/retry rather than pretending a score was saved.
- The demo fallback is **not** the production database. Verify the yellow demo banner disappears after Firebase is configured.
- The hero and game cards are original CSS/vector designs with Sheridan-inspired styling. For official Sheridan logos, request the approved brand assets from Sheridan's communications team.

## Before doors open — quick checklist

- [ ] Firebase configuration added and demo banner gone
- [ ] Anonymous Authentication enabled, Firestore Rules published
- [ ] Confirm registration + PIN returns on two **different** computers
- [ ] Play Tech Sprint and verify the other computer's leaderboard changes **without refresh**
- [ ] Check replays: a lower score does not lower or increase the player's total
- [ ] Verify Switch Player and idle timeout behavior
- [ ] Run the leaderboard fullscreen on the actual display
- [ ] Test a mobile/tablet screen and the event Wi-Fi
- [ ] Replace placeholder games as each becomes playable

## Sheridan Campus Quest integration (November 2026)

Campus Quest is now available as a competitive game inside the same GitHub Pages website:

- Hub card: `games/campus-quest/home.html`
- Level 1: `games/campus-quest/game/game.html?level=1`
- Level 2: `games/campus-quest/game/game.html?level=2`

The game uses the **existing Game Hub 4-digit player code** and Firebase project.
Do **not** enable the standalone Campus Quest email/password login or publish its old `firestore.rules`;
those are deliberately not included in the integrated game.

### Required: publish the new Game Hub Firestore rules

Open Firebase Console → your **Game Hub project** → Firestore Database → Rules.
Replace the deployed rules with the updated root `firestore.rules` in this project and click **Publish**.
The two additional allowed score IDs are `campus-quest-level-1` and `campus-quest-level-2`.
Committing this file to GitHub alone **does not deploy Firestore rules**.

### Fair points across games

Campus Quest contains two playable levels. Each level's best score is stored as
its own 0–100 document, but they count together as **one** competitive game:

`Campus Quest points = round((Level 1 best + Level 2 best) / 2)`

Example: 100 on Level 1 plus 80 on Level 2 → 90 Campus Quest points, not 180.
A completed Level 1 (even a score of zero) unlocks Level 2 on other stations using the same player code.
Tech Sprint remains independently worth up to 100 points.

For a future event with additional Campus Quest levels, add their level files and
manifest entries, change the **single** `SCORED_LEVEL_COUNTS["campus-quest"]`
setting in `js/config.js`, then run `node scripts/sync-firestore-rules.mjs`
and **publish** the generated rules in Firebase Console. Do not increase the
scored-level count during an existing event.

### Shared files and protections

- Original level backgrounds, hotspot coordinates, clues, and timing rules are retained.
- `games/campus-quest/js/hub-integration.js` bridges the existing player and scoring store.
- No second database, no new web API keys, and no independent Campus Quest leaderboard.
- `games/campus-quest/css/hub-integration.css` adds the shared player/points header.
- Quest gameplay does not time out while actively in progress; the idle timer resumes after completion.
- As with other static-client games, browser-reported results are **not cheat-proof**.

### Tests

Run `node --test tests/*.mjs` to validate scoring, unlocks, returning-player behavior,
and best-attempt updates. The test suite uses isolated demo storage and does not
write to live Firebase. Also test the actual deployed portal on a phone and on two
separate computers before Open House. QR codes should point to the published site,
not to localhost.

## Hardware Challenge and shared level scoring (November 2026)

**Playable URL:** `games/hardware-challenge/index.html`. The portal card is enabled.

Hardware Challenge has **two scored ways to play**:

- **Explore Hardware:** select one of the hardware photos, identify random components, and save your best level result.
- **Quick Challenge:** get a randomly selected hardware level (prefer unplayed levels), answer random questions, and save to that **same** level result. Playing both modes does **not** double your points.

Both modes share the same hotspot renderer, photo zoom tools, second-chance feedback, and short explanations. Each round selects a configured number of distinct targets (4–6, depending on the level) from its question bank; an answer correct on the first try earns 10 question points, second try 5, and two misses 0. The round total is normalized to a whole score out of 100 and only the **best completed score per level** is saved. Hotspots are SVG polygons aligned against the included photographs. Keyboard users can Tab through regions and press Enter; zoom buttons help on phones.

### Change the level count in ONE place for a future event

Open **`js/config.js`** and find:

```js
export const SCORED_LEVEL_COUNTS = Object.freeze({
  "campus-quest": 2,
  "hardware-challenge": 7,
});
```

**This is the only place you edit the number of scored levels.** Every scored level has equal weight, unplayed levels count as zero, and the single combined score per game is the rounded average of level bests. Thus Hardware Challenge with 7 levels: `round((L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 + L5 + L6 + L7) / 7)`, maximum **100 Sheridan Points** total. Campus Quest with 2 levels: `round((L1 + L2) / 2)`. Scores always reflect the same formula in the game result and in the live leaderboard. Replay scores never replace a higher score.

**Freeze the counts during an Open House.** For a future event that uses more scored levels:

1. Add the next numbered level(s) and their photo/hotspot/question data to `games/hardware-challenge/hardware-data.js`; put the corresponding images in `games/hardware-challenge/assets/`.
2. In `js/config.js`, set the **new eventId** and change only the corresponding entry in `SCORED_LEVEL_COUNTS` (e.g. Hardware Challenge from `5` to `7`). **Do not change the count mid-event**, since that would alter scores already on the live leaderboard.
3. Run `node scripts/sync-firestore-rules.mjs` once. This generates the exact level-score IDs allowed by Firestore from the same config. **Publish the updated root `firestore.rules` in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules**. Committing rules to GitHub alone will not publish them.
4. Run `node --test tests/*.mjs` and test on a phone + two computers before opening the event.

All seven hardware missions are now part of the scored roster: Levels 1–5, **Laptop Repair Lab** (Level 6), and **Ports & Connections** (Level 7). Publishing the matching generated Firestore rules is required for live score submissions. Changing the denominator from five to seven recalculates existing standings; use a new event ID to preserve the previous event's rankings.

### Hardware image fidelity and hotspot review

The first four assets are the user's **approved `hc1.png`–`hc4.png` images copied without alteration** (byte-for-byte); these were derived from the professor's photos using earlier image editing and may contain minor AI-rendered differences from the physical hardware. We use large, visually verifiable parts rather than tiny printed chip labels. `hc1` is the wireless adapter, `hc2` is the **two-slot** ASUS motherboard, `hc3` is the Dell board with its CPU installed, and `hc4` is the **four-slot** ASUS motherboard. All hotspots are newly mapped against the exact approved images, rather than the previous original-photo crops.

The fifth image is `hc5.png`, a generated server interior; its 15 hotspot targets are defined separately in `hardware-server-level.js`. A hidden QA aid shows every region outline for verification: open
`games/hardware-challenge/index.html?debug=hotspots` after joining. You can zoom the images and compare region boundaries against the physical component. The hotspots are configured as pixel-coordinate polygons in `hardware-data.js`, including separate polygon regions for repeated parts such as RAM slots and SATA connectors. Changing the image, crop or its dimensions **requires remapping the hotspot coordinates**. All pages have a **Back to Hardware Challenge** button; an unfinished round requires confirmation before exiting. Keep the saved level IDs stable after launch to preserve scores.

The user-facing physical-display status isn't guessed from the photo. Future hardware can be added digitally even if no physical version is available at the event.


### Replacing the previous Hardware Challenge assets (HC hotspot update)

The approved files `hc1.png` through `hc4.png` are used without resizing, cropping or modifying the images. The **game's level order** is HC2 (two-RAM ASUS), HC4 (four-RAM ASUS), HC3 (Dell), HC1 (wireless adapter). This retains your original four level score IDs.

If you apply the **update-only ZIP** over an older checkout, the four old `.jpg` assets are unused and can be deleted to avoid storing duplicate photos:

```sh
rm games/hardware-challenge/assets/asus-two-slots.jpg \
   games/hardware-challenge/assets/asus-four-slots.jpg \
   games/hardware-challenge/assets/dell-motherboard.jpg \
   games/hardware-challenge/assets/wifi-adapter.jpg
```

The full project ZIP has these obsolete JPGs already removed.

The **Back to Hardware Challenge** button is visible in Explore Hardware, gameplay and the result screen. Exiting an unfinished level asks for confirmation before discarding that attempt. Neither scoring rules nor Firebase configuration changed in this update.


### Limitations and testing

- This static GitHub Pages site does not have a trusted backend, so a determined visitor could forge game outcomes. The Firestore rules constrain the allowed score IDs, ranges, player membership and best-score updates; they do not prove that someone tapped the right component.
- The score ID allowlist is generated by `scripts/sync-firestore-rules.mjs`; whenever you edit the scoring config you must regenerate **and publish** the rules.
- User scores are tied to the existing shared four-digit player code and existing Firebase project. No second account or Firebase project is needed.
- Local/demo mode saves only on that browser. Check that the demo banner disappears in your production deployment.
